1: Files for a C# Simple Calculator. It does not exactly work as expected.
Images for the calculator are created by me. They don't look near as big on the actual form.
Edit: Redid the calculator using what I learned from messing with the designer and the code already posted here.
It works now! I may try to add keyboard functionality.
